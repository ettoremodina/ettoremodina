## Academic Background
I hold a degree in Mathematical Engineering and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistical Learning.

## Interests
Passionate about various aspects of statistics, I am currently mastering nonparametric methods, Bayesian models, and machine learning techniques. My interests also extend to programming languages such as C++, Python, and R, which I use on a daily basis. Additionally, I am proficient in MATLAB and GAMS, the latter being used for optimization models.
