# Ettore Modina – GitHub Portfolio

## Academic Background
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Engineering and a Master's degree in Statistical Learning at Politecnico di Milano, with a focus on Machine Learning and Physics-Informed Modeling.

## Interests
I am passionate about data science, with strong interests in Bayesian statistics, nonparametric methods, and deep learning. I regularly work with Python, R, and C++, and I am also proficient in MATLAB and GAMS, particularly for optimization modeling. I enjoy building AI systems from scratch, especially when they involve creative or theoretical challenges.

I’ve complemented my academic background with hands-on work in Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and digital twin modeling.

## GitHub Repositories
